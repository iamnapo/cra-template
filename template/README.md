# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the [@iamnapo/cra-template](https://github.com/iamnapo/cra-template).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm test`

Runs eslint & cypress e2e test.

### `npm run analyze`

Analyzes JavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code bloat is coming from.\
More info at [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. You don’t have to ever use `eject`. It‘s better to delete it from the `scripts` section of `package.json`.
